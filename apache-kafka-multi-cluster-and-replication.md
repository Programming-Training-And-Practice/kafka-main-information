# Apache Kafka Multi Cluster and Replication



##
* Kafka can only operate well in a single region(geographical region)
* Therefore, it is very common for enterprise to have Kafka clusters across the world, with some level of replication between them.
* A replication application at its core is just a consumer + a producer
* There are different tools to perform it:
  * Mirror Maker - open source tool that ships with Kafka
  * Netflix uses Flink - they wrote their own application
  * Uber uses uReplicator - address performance and operations issues with MM
  * Comcast has their own open source Kafka Connector Source
  * Confluent has their own Kafka Connect Source

* Overall, try these and see if it works for your use case before writing your own
* There are two designs for cluster replication:
  * Active => Active 
    * You have a global application
    * You have a global dataset
  * Active => Passive
    * You want to have an aggregation cluster (for example for analytic) 
    * You want to create some form of disaster recovery strategy(*its hard)
    * Cloud migration (from on-premise cluster to Cloud Cluster)
  * Replicating doesn't preserve offsets, just data!
